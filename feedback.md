1. you might want to improve performance on mobile, otherwise google will limit your organic growth rate in search

2. headline
- I would rephrase the headline so that it quantifies the results and makes a challenging promise - something like "Streamline Your Job Search and Land Interviews 5x Faster."
- I would avoid negative sentiment, humans are driven by emotion when evaluating products - “Never miss another opportunity...”; once against, focus on highlighting possible results and benefits - "Track, Organize, and Land More Interviews with Ease"
- cta "Join Waitlist" is fine, but IMHO you might want to make it less passive, at least at the top of the page. e.g. “Get Started Today” or "Sign Up for Early Access"

2. layout
- page contains a lot of text; not necessarily a bad thing, just an observation that might make it overwhelming for some users
- spacing needs work; copy would be easier to digest is spaced properly
- may be too early to recommend this, but consider testing with accessibility benchmarks to ensure maximum adoption by googlebots

3. "Features that Make the Difference"
- imho spacing is bad here; description paragraphs should be aligned with headings, not with icon vertically
- i would exclude "coming soon"; better to oversell the undersell imho if this feature really is coming soon and you're testing pre-launch demand anyway

4. pricing
- overall good copy
- you need to work a bit more on justifying paid options and discouraging users from sticking with free (i do hope that you can afford to run freemium)
- visually i would highlight paid options more, so that it's visually appealing to stay away from free :)
- for more detail-oriented users a large table with detailed difference breakdowns might be attractive (maybe on a separate page)

5. Social Proof and Trust Signals
- great that you have testimonials, but feels generic and doesn't build credibility all that much; consider putting up some logos, faces, names, etc.
- show some numbers; users love numbers; e.g. 100k+ applications tracked are good stats

6. security / compliance
- in hiring compliance might be a serious concern for larger enterprises; i'd say something along the lines "working on securing soc2" if you want to indicate that enterprises are on your radar

8. mobile
- you need to work on mobile layout, ideally the page should be mobile-first

9. next steps
- analytics + a/b is a good idea for continuing iteration on the landing page
- i didn't do a thorough seo analysis, but from technical standpoint all the best practices seem to be covered so far; just validate your keywords with google ads and other marketing tools
